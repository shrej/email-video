## Features

- **Save time and effort by easily adding video thumbnails with a play button**<br>
  Simply type in the destination URL. If the video is hosted on Youtube/Dailymotion we get your thumbnail from the service. If the video is hosted elsewhere customize the thumbnail by adding your own image.

- **Ability to Track video clicks and execute automation with Pardot Custom Redirects**<br>
  Leverage the full power of Pardot custom redirects without ever leaving the Email Content Builder

- **Tested on multiple email clients with Litmus**<br>
  The play button is rendered on almost all modern email clients. For legacy clients like outlook, we fallback to an image.

- **Fallback for environments where images are blocked**<br>
  Support for corporate environments where images in Email are blocked

- **Coded with accessibility in mind**

- **Customize the video play button to light or dark shade**<br>
  Customize the play button to match your thumbnail background
