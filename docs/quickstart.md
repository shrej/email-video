# Getting Started with Video for Email Templates

We have designed this component to be used with or without a Pardot Account.
If you connect a Pardot Account, you get the additional ability to add custom redirects as your destination without ever leaving the Email Template Builder.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the component**<br>
   Though you can install this component directly in a production org, we recommend installing it in a sandbox first.

1. **Now go to any lightning email template in your org, and click Edit in builder**<br>
   If you do not see the "Edit in builder" option, please follow the instructions [here.](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_template_builder_create.htm&type=0)

## Usage

1. Select a Custom Redirect for the video thumbnail
1. Optionally, you can also set a custom image as your thumbnail
1. Choose from Light/ Dark play button to best suit your image
